# PyKubed
This is our attempt at improving the Gesture recognition in the Microsoft Kinect. We have done pretty much everything from scratch. 
We have even modified the Drivers to enable fast mapping of color and depth plots. The default became slower with time due to RAM issues.

### Things To-Do #
- Skeleton map[Done]
- Hand recognition and segmentation[Done]
    ![Segmented Hand](https://github.com/abhirajD/PyKubed/blob/master/Images/hand1.jpg)
    ![Hand_Body Interface](https://github.com/abhirajD/PyKubed/blob/master/Codes/Abhi/hand_body.jpg)
    ![Filtered Hand](https://github.com/abhirajD/PyKubed/blob/master/Images/openhand.png)
- Feature Extraction[Done]
- Gesture classification[Done]
- Augmented reality engine[Done]
- Modularize everything(API)
- Finish till gesture classification by 1-2-2016[Kinda Done]

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
    Get more gestures to be supported by Kinect (Well, this is a generic approach, could be used with any Depth streamer). Get the gesture classifier to perform better.
* Version: 2.0.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Dependencies: PyKinect2, Numpy, OpenCV
* Configuration:
Its simple: Clone the repository, cd to directory and python run the main_*.py in cmd/terminal. (Do SSPY :P)
